    <h1>Welcome To My Page</h1>
    <p>When setting weight loss goals, it’s important to focus not only on losing fat, but also on retaining muscle mass.<br> Skeletal muscle supports the body’s structure and generates essential movements, such as walking, personal grooming and eating. <br>Unintentional muscle loss can affect other aspects of health as well, including bone health, heart health and longevity. <br>Alternatively, gaining muscle not only minimizes these risks, but also contributes to calorie burning (even at rest) since muscle is denser and more metabolically active than fat.<br>

        While some muscle loss may be inevitable with caloric restriction and certain exercise regimens, it’s possible to lose fat and gain muscle at the same time, better benefiting the body as a result.<br> Read on to learn more about how to lose body fat and gain muscle simultaneously, plus health and safety considerations to keep in mind.</p><br>
    <h1>How to Measure Fat Loss</h1>
    <p>
        There are four helpful ways to measure body fat, according to Chavez and Robert Iafelice, a registered dietitian at Set for Set, a company that sells supplements,<br> gym equipment and workout programs, and author of Hold on to Your Muscle, Be Free of Disease:<br>
        
        Skinfold measurements, which are measured with calipers and plugged into an equation that calculates body fat.<br>
        Bioelectrical impedance scales, which measure body fat, muscle mass and water percentage through the use of painless electrical currents.<br>
        Hydrostatic weighing, which measures body fat through how much water is displaced when you’re submerged in water.<br>
        Dual energy x-ray absorptiometry (or DEXA) scan which is a type of x-ray that captures images and determines body fat and muscle mass.</p>
